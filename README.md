# Example Java Wiremock Consumer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pactflow/pactflow-example-consumer-wiremock.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pactflow/pactflow-example-consumer-wiremock)

This is an example of a Java consumer that uses Wiremock (with Junit5), [Pactflow](https://pactflow.io) and Travis CI to ensure that it is compatible with the expectations its consumers have of it.

The project uses a Makefile to simulate a very simple build pipeline with two stages - test and deploy.

It is using a public tenant on Pactflow, which you can access [here](https://test.pact.dius.com.au) using the credentials `dXfltyFMgNOFZAxr8io9wJ37iUpY42M`/`O5AIZWxelWbLvqMd8PkAVycBJh2Psyg1`.

See the canonical consumer example here: https://github.com/pactflow/example-consumer
See also the full [Pactflow CI/CD Workshop](https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/workshops/ci-cd) for which this can be substituted in as the "consumer".
